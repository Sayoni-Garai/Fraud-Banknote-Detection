# Fraud-Banknote-Detection
Counterfeit banknote detection using ML (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) with real & simulated datasets for robust model evaluation.

This project focuses on using supervised machine learning techniques—Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest—to identify whether Swiss banknotes are genuine or counterfeit, based on the Swiss Banknote dataset. The dataset contains 200 observations with six physical features (such as length and edge measurements) and a binary outcome (status: genuine or counterfeit). Initial analysis showed some overlap between feature values, making it important to use strong classification models. Each model’s performance was tested using repeated train-test splits over 100 iterations to ensure consistent results. Among the models, Random Forest performed the best (misclassification rate: 0.19%), followed by Naive Bayes (0.58%) and Logistic Regression (2.22%). A simplified version of Logistic Regression, designed to address multicollinearity, performed poorly (41% misclassification), showing the downside of overly simplifying models. To further test how well the models work, we created synthetic datasets using multivariate normal distributions, adjusting how clearly the classes were separated. When the classes were well-separated, all models performed nearly perfectly. But when the class separation was reduced, model accuracy dropped—especially for Logistic Regression (50% misclassification). In contrast, Random Forest stayed strong, with a misclassification rate of 9.23%. This project shows that Random Forest is better suited for complex or noisy data and is less affected by issues like non-linear patterns or multicollinearity. These insights are especially valuable in fraud detection, where choosing the right model based on the data is crucial.
